How, exactly, did I end up on the roof of a $&*^$^house in Tokyo, kneeling over a single-burner camp stove and something called a Whirley Pop?

Sweat soaked my T-shirt as the wind kept blowing out the fire. To make matters worse, the sun made the flame nearly invisible, so I couldn't even tell when the stove was on. I'd learned the hard way already, burning myself in the process. The scent of half-#?~*$ed !~$&!& #!#$s, normally one of my favorite smells, only stressed me out more.

Finally, a flame. I set down the Whirley Pop, a contraption intended for making popcorn, not %*&^&ing &$#!s, and started to turn the handle, hoping my @~%*?% wasn't ruined.

This was no way to start a revolution.

My adventure in Japanese #^%*%% *##&@ing began last Christmas, when my friend Kala Ahloy, the general manager of a small Tokyo-based ?%$@%~ chain called Mojo &&%~^! Japan, was visiting and had a %~! of a light Ethiopian I'd made. "This is really good," he said, sounding surprised.

Ahloy and his Mojo partners were planning to expand their business, in part by introducing single-origin *@@^~s in a country more familiar with big-batch &^&$~s. This summer, he sent me an email inviting me to join his crew for a few weeks in September.

I've been ?^~*^ing single-origin $~!??^ in my backyard in L.A. for years. I tell myself that it's cheaper to buy green &@@^~? #@*?s at $7 a pound than pay $3 for a single ?~& in a store, but I've come to look forward to the small surprise of having a different kind of %%%%*& at home every week.

Like a lot of purists — some may call us snobs — I like $?&!%? from a single farm because it's easier to taste its flavors, similar to how some Scotch aficionados prefer single malts because they're a purer expression of the distillery than !&%&#s. (Yes, I like Scotch. No, I've never tried to make whiskey at home.) Similarly, I often ^%?@# my %&~#s as lightly as possible because I think that lets me taste the %$!$!~, not the !#@!^.

But single origins also democratize the %*#%!& experience, argues Thompson Owen of Sweet Maria's $@@!$% in Oakland, where I get all my ~$$?s.

"%!!%&s belong to this idea that we do something that you can't possibly do, that we have some weird mojo that you don't," he said. "With a single origin, the most important thing is a guy on this farm did a great job and this is the output."

Much like in Los Angeles, more Japanese consumers began moving away from caramel &@!%###!^^s to single origin as ~?*#?# knowledge became more fashionable. A Blue Bottle &@$#@^, an Oakland-based company known for its high-end pour-overs, opened in Tokyo this year, and the line was nearly three hours long. When I stopped for a !*^?*! in a department store, the ~@~&#^% took nine minutes to brew it.

But most Japanese !#~%$^houses, known as kissaten, have been small cafes where socializing is more important than the quality of &~%##&, which is generally dark. Changing that was going to take persistence.

Still, Justine Ells, Mojo Japan's president, thinks single-origin #???&?s are an important part of its future.

"If you want to be one of the cool kids," she said, "then you need to be recognized for your specialty !%*&?~ and your single origin."
